Design an interface called IFruit.

The IFruit interface should have the following methods.

void fruitname();

void quantity(double k);

double price();

Strawberry, Pear, Apple and Watermelon classes must implement the IFruit interface.

All these classes must fill the methods they need to override.

The price information of the classes is obtained by multiplying the amount of kg received and the price of kg.

According to this information, the quantity and kilogram price information should be defined for each class and taken from the user.

Actions should be taken according to the following scenario.

At least 1 object must be defined from each fruit. 

Show the cost of each fruit and the total cost amount on the screen according to the quantity and price information of the fruits received from the user.
