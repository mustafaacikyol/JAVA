Design an abstract class called Fruit.

Fruit abstract class should have the following methods.

void fruitname();

double price();

The Strawberry, Pear, Apple, and Watermelon classes should extend the Fruit abstract class.

All these classes must fill in the methods they need to override.

The price information of the classes is obtained by multiplying the amount of kg received and the price of kg. This property must be in the abstract class.

According to this information, the kg and kilogram price information should be defined in the abstract class and transferred to the super class when each object is derived.

Actions should be taken according to the following scenario.

At least 1 object must be defined from each fruit.

Show the cost of each fruit and the total cost amount on the screen according to the kg and price information of the fruits received from the user.
