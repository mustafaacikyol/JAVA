-You are requested to create a four-entry menu.
1.Count the number of characters.
2.Find the common characters between the two words.
3.Convert Sentence to ArrayList.
4.Output

From the user menu:
If user chooses option 1;
   It counts the number of characters of a sentence entered by the user and writes it to the screen.
If user chooses option 2;
   It finds the common characters between two words entered by the user and writes them on the screen.
If user chooses option 3;
   It allows each of the words in the sentence entered by the user to be written to the screen by using a loop by placing them into the ArrayList. The way of printing to the screen should be the same as the output of the toString method.
If user chooses option 4;
  The program must terminate with exit.

As long as the user does not exit, the program must return to the menu section continuously.
